## BaseShapelyGridProps
`src/components/types`

**AST Node Type:** *TypeAliasDeclaration*

#### JSDoc annotations:

All of the specialized Polgyon Grids accept these base properties.

```bash

```

#### Code:

```ts
export type BaseShapelyGridProps = {
    children?: ReactNode;
    rowSize?: number;
    spacing?: CSSNumeric;
    offset?: number;
};

```

## Hoverable
`src/components/types`

**AST Node Type:** *TypeAliasDeclaration*

#### JSDoc annotations:

For now I want to support hover effects I will have to find a more extensible method as I add in more responsive controls.

```bash

```

#### Code:

```ts
export type Hoverable<T> = T | [
    T,
    T
];

```

## PolyMorphic
`src/components/types`

**AST Node Type:** *TypeAliasDeclaration*

#### JSDoc annotations:

PolyMorphic is a type decorator to describe the properties of an overridable react component.

Providing a valid ElementType to the as property will allow a developer to override the root element of a component while still respecting linting rules in typescript.

as such the properties will be a combination of the root element type and the properties provided to P.

```bash

```

#### Code:

```ts
export type PolyMorphic<P, T extends ElementType> = PolyMorphProps<T> & P;

```
