## Vector
`src/geometry/types`

**AST Node Type:** *TypeAliasDeclaration*

#### JSDoc annotations:

The vector type is used to declare the 2 dimensional point along with an angle to use as a trajectory.

```bash

```

#### Code:

```ts
export type Vector = [
    number,
    number,
    number
];

```

## Rect
`src/geometry/types`

**AST Node Type:** *TypeAliasDeclaration*

#### JSDoc annotations:

This is a min max rect where the first two numbers are the min coordinate and the last two numbers are the max coordinates in the rect.

```bash

```

#### Code:

```ts
export type Rect = [
    Point,
    Point,
    Point
];

```

## SupportedPointMathTypes
`src/geometry/types`

**AST Node Type:** *TypeAliasDeclaration*

#### JSDoc annotations:

Really I just need the numeric values provided by the additional points all the math will be relative to the point the function is being called from. therefore I can simplify the process by not requiring a point be provided. this will reduce necessary new calls and Point instances.

```bash

```

#### Code:

```ts
export type SupportedPointMathTypes = Point | [
    number,
    number
];

```
