# Shapely
Shapely is a library designed to simplify the rendering of shapes in an html document. Shapely is not a replacement for the full capability of SVG so all components are designed to accept all the properties accepted by the used underlying svg components. With that the Components work greate as foundational elements to build and style from.

## Getting Started

Install Shapely
```bash
npm install @irwinproject/shapely
```

### Polygons 
Shapely has Special Named components for each of the regular polygons as well as a more configurable Polygon Component. These shapes are generated by selecting points around the perimeter of a 1x1 circle where (0,0) is the center. additionally because all shapes are vecotrized pixel units should not be provided instead use values between 0 and 1 representing the least and largest dimensions. 

```tsx
import { Triangle } from '@irwinproject/shapely';

const Component = ({children})=>(<Triangle 
	cornerRadius={0.05} 
	backgroundColor: "#F00", 
	stroke="#000" 
	strokeWidth={0.1}
	>
		{children}
	</Triangle>);
```
And just like that we have a component with a triangle backing layer. 

Shapely is designed to be flexible and overridable. For example

```css
#my-awesome-hexagon{

}
```
